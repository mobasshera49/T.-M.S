	<p>Paharpur an important archaeological site in Bangladesh, situated in a village named Paharpur (Pahadpur) under the Badalgachhi Upazila of Naogaon district. The village is connected with the nearby Railway station Jamalganj, the district town Naogaon and Jaipurhat town by metalled roads. It is in the midst of alluvial flat plain of northern Bangladesh. In contrast to the monotonous level of the plain, stands the ruins of the lofty (about 24m high from the surrounding level) ancient temple which was covered with jungle, locally called Pahar or hill from which the palace got the name of Paharpur.

The site was first noticed by Buchanon Hamilton in course of his survey in Eastern India between 1807 and 1812. Westmacott next visited it. Sir Alexander Cunningham visited the place in 1879. Cunningham intended to carry out an extensive excavation in the mound. But he was prevented by zamindar of Balihar, the owner of the land. So he had to be satisfied with limited excavation in a small part of the monastic area and top of the central mound. In the latter area he 'discovered the ruins of a square tower of 6.70m (22 ft) side with a projection in the middle of each side'. The site was declared to be protected by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1919 under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904. </p>

The place Sompur (Paharpur) was in between the capital city Pundranagar and other city Kotibarsha of the ancient realm Pundrabardhan of the Pal-Dynasty. The Bihar has a long archeological history which demonstrate us the proof of our establishment of many thousands of years.</p>

	<p>St. Martin's Island is very popular tourist spot. Now, 3 (three) shipping liners run Everyday trips to the island, including Sea-Truck and Keary-Sindbad. If you want to visit this land you can book your trip either from Chittagong or from Cox's Bazar.
Last 5 years St. Martin's visitor population has increased dramatically. While this situation has proven to be lucrative for the islanders, 

it is causing the natural beauty of the island to deteriorate. Presently there are many efforts being put forth to preserve the several endagered species of turtles that nest on the island, as well as the corals, some of which are found only on Narikel Jinjera. Pieces of the coral reef are being removed in order to be sold to tourists.[1] Nesting turtles are sometimes taken for food, and their hatchlings are often distracted by the twinkling lights along the beach. Species of fish, a few just recently discovered, are being overfished. Every year the fishermen must venture further out to sea to get their catch. Most of them use motorless boats.<p>

	<p>The Mosque City of Bagerhat is a formerly lost city, located in the suburbs of Bagerhat city in Bagerhat District, in the Khulna Division of southwest of Bangladesh. Bagerhat is about 15 miles south east of Khulna and 200 miles southwest of Dhaka.[1]

    Originally known as Khalifatabad and nicknamed the "mint town of the Bengal Sultanate",[2] the city was founded in the 15th century by the warrior saint Turkish general Ulugh Khan Jahan.[3]

    The historic city, listed by Forbes as one of the 15 lost cities of the world, has more than 50 Islamic monuments in the distinct Bengal variant of Indo-Islamic architecture. These were uncovered after removing the vegetation that had obscured them from view for many centuries. The site has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 under criteria (iv), "as an outstanding example of an architectural ensemble which illustrates a significant stage in human history",[4] of which the Sixty Pillar Mosque (Shat Gombuj Masjid in Bengali), constructed with 60 pillars and 77 domes, is the most well known.[2][5] Apart from these monuments, UNESCO also includes the mausoleum of Khan Jahan, the mosques of Singar, Bibi Begni, Reza Khoda, Zindavir among the unique monuments.[4][6]<p>

	<p>Kuakata is known for its picturesque landscape beauty of panoramic beach, clear blue sky, the tides of the bay bashing on the shore and its mangrove forest. The beach is about 30 kilometers in length, 6 kilometers in breadth and situated at the Lotachapli Union, Kolapara Thana, Patuakhali District. It’s unique as there are no other beaches in Bangladesh where you can witness both sunrise and sunset. Jhaubon (Jhau forest) is an exquisite place in Kuakata which is close to the beach.

    Jhau forest is established as a result of initiative taken by government. You can reach Jhaubon by walking from the beach. Jhaubon is covered by Jhau and coconut trees. It’s a wonderful place for observing the sunrise. An Eco Park exists at Jhaubon area which is a fascinating place for picnic or junket. To the east of Jhau forest, there is Gangamati Reserved Forest. So you should visit both Jhaubon and Gangamati Reserved Forest at the same time. Jhaubon is a wonderful place to calm down & very well-acquainted for visitors. Each year, many tourists come here for pleasure.<p>

	<p>The scenery of the waterfall is just amazing and a pleasure to watch. Nestled amidst the lush green mountains Madhabkunda makes for an ideal tourist destination. The waterfall remains crowded all round the year though the most tourists come during the winter season. The journey to Madhabkunda itself is exotic. On the way you can see the greenish beauty of tea garden, the hills and the zigzag road through the hills will increase the joy of your journey.

    The amount of water during rainy season is massive. It seems like a bolt from the Norse God Thor is falling at the bottom of the fall. Also if you are lucky, and its raining, then you will find multiple of water streams are dropping from the top of the waterfall.
    During the rainy season, you are not allowed to get at the bottom of the fall. First reason is, the force of the water will simple kill you. Second reason is the stones are falling with water sometimes. Police and other security people are always patrolling the waterfall.<p>
